Recipe Website

Featuring recipes for three of the most delicious meals.

This project combines all aspects of web development I have encountered until now on The Odin Project:
1. Using git (pushin/pulling data from repository to my local machine)
2. Writing HTML documents using a few basic elements and attributes that change de behaviour of those elements
3. Using links to move around my website and to embed images
