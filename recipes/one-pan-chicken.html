            <li>1/3 tsp Black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp Paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp Coriander</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your chicken thighs into 2 cm wide strips. Add them to a bowl and mix them with the seasonings.</li>
            <li>Cut your potatoes into wedges.</li>
            <li>In a frying pan, pour 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add your chicken and cook it at high heat for 5 minutes on each side.</li>
            <li>Take the chicken out and put them aside.</li>
            <li>We now put the potatoes into the pan, allowing the wedges to absorb the flavour from the chicken juice(now at medium heat).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut the onions, bell pepper, chili pepper.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes gain a nice brown color(like in the picture below), take them out and replace them with the onions we just cut(4 minutes).</li>

            <li>Now add the peppers and cook for 4 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and potatoes at low heat while we cut the greens.</li>
            <li>Finely cut the dill, parsley and green onions. Save a bit of the greens to use at the end, and add the rest of them to the pan.</li>
            <li>Cut the cherry tomatoes into halves. Crush the garlic cloves and add them both to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add your seasonings and mix.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan and let it simmer for 10 minutes at low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the greens we saved and plate accordingly.</li>
        </ol>
